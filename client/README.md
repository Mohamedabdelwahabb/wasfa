# Wasfa

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
  -mui
- JSX
- Firebase/Firestore
- npm
- git
- GitHub

## Use case

- Overview page to browse through available recipes.
- Detail page for every specific recipe.
- Create, Update and Delete Recipes.
- Step-by-step instructions in a clearly distinguishable way.
- Add Ingredient list
- Searching & Filtering
- If the app is opened in the morning, you can suggest a few breakfast ideas.
- Dynamically adjust the ingredients based on the number of people
- From food prepping -> get one list of ingredients as a shopping list
- Rating
- Use voice recognition to add to your shopping list
- Add Images
- Add instructional videos

## Setup/Installation Requirements

- Open the terminal on your desktop
- Once in the terminal, use it to navigate to your desktop folder
- Once inside your desktop folder, use the command ``
- After cloning the project, navigate into it using the command `cd wasfa/client`
- Use the command `git remote` to confirm the creation of the new local repository
- Install project dependencies by running the command `npm install`
- If you receive errors in the terminal, try running `npm install` again, sometimes npm can be finicky
- Then run the command `npm run start` to start the project server and view the application (use ctrl + c to exit the server in the terminal)
- Open the project with the code editor of your choice

## Future Plans

- Implement OAuth for easy account creation and login
- Add more search filters as well as a search bar

## Known Bugs

- Currently users cannot directly edit their ingredients. If you need to edit an ingredient, unfortunatley you will need to delete the recipe and start over.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
